# Pandas DataFrame Analysis

This repository contains a pandas project where I explored a DataFrame containing information about words. In this project, I performed various analyses using the pandas library in Python.

## Overview

The DataFrame contains information about words, including their character count (`Char Count`), numerical value (`Value`), and a calculated `Ratio` which is the `Value` of a word divided by its length.

### Data Information

- **Number of Elements in DataFrame:** 172821

## Key Findings

### 1. Word Values

- **Value of 'microspectrophotometries':** 317
- **Highest Value in DataFrame:** 319
- **Word with Value 319:** reinstitutionalizations

### 2. Word Characteristics

- **Highest Possible Length of a Word:** 28
- **Shortest Word with Value 274:** overprotectivenesses

### 3. Word Analysis

- **Words with Char Count 7 and Value 87:**
  - glowing

- **Words with Value 100:**
  - Number of words: 1921

- **Most Common Value:**
  - Value: 93

### 4. Ratio Analysis

- **Maximum Value of Ratio:** 22.5
- **Word with Highest Ratio:** xu
- **Words with Ratio of 10:**
  - Number of words: 2604
  - Maximum Value: 240

### 5. Specific Word Analysis

- **Word with Value 260 and Lowest Char Count:**
  - hydroxytryptamine
  - Char Count: 17
  - Ratio: 15.294118

## Usage

You can view the detailed analysis and code in the `P_Words.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository. The notebook contains step-by-step analysis, code explanations, and results for each of the tasks mentioned above.

## Data Source
The words used in this project was sourced from [dolph/dictionary](https://github.com/dolph/dictionary).
